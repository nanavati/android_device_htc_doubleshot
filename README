Ice Cream Sandwich device tree for HTC Pyramid (Sensation)

Kernel:
-HTC 3.0.16 kernel from 3.32.401.5 ota

Current issues:
-wifi tethering doesn't work
-camcorder doesn't work
-bluetooth has various issues

Misc issues:
-Invensys MPU cannot be built from source since we do not have access to
 HTC kernel module IOCTLs, using sensors.pyramid from 3.32 leak
-Audio uses HTC libs, since audio libs from source doesn't record properly
-Video playback is possible using 3.32 leak OMX libs or using ics-omx
 frameworks/base branch, HW Deconding is problematic
-It should be theoretically possible for wifi calling to work, since the
 kineto.ko module exists

Building:
-hardware/libhardware_legacy, branch ics_dev
